# Elastic Observability on AWS
Overcome data silos to transform your data into actionable insights

## Welcome

In this workshop you will learn how to use Elastic in your AWS environment.

## Workshop Agenda
- Deploy Elastic in AWS Marketplace
- Activate AWS data collection integrations
- Activate pre defined rules
- Build custom rules
- Build your first custom dashboard

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to deploy Elastic in AWS
- Learn how to get any data from your AWS environments into Elastic
- Best practices for using the AWS data in regards to Observability, Security and Search

## Who should attend
This workshop is targeted towards roles in the following areas:

*Application Development:* Develop software, apps and services, and are responsible for creating observable code, and helping debug and fix code-level issues in dev & prod.

*DevOps / SRE / Operations / Application Support:* Responsible for maintaining service availability, performance, and reliability SLAs, and resolving issues when they occur

## Background knowledge for the Workshop

We start from scratch. So no prior knowledge needed to complete the workshop. However having some kind of Elastic knowledge helps to get it done more efficiently and learn some tips and tricks at the same time.

## Expected time
Weâ€™ve planned this workshop to be finished within 1-2 hours. You can pause at any time and continue working. However, the trial period for your Elastic Cluster within the AWS Marketplace is 7 days. After that period, your trial will automatically transform into a paid subscription if you do not delete the environment.
