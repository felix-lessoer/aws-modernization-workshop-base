## Start the Elastic Environment via AWS Marketplace

Follow the video below to see how to enable Elastic via AWS Marketplace as well as how to get the credentials for the Elastic environment. As we will use a cloud formation script in order to prepare your workshop environment including an example application - you need to run a different script then the one in the video. However this is still a good starting point if you like to test it also within your own AWS environment in a later stage.
