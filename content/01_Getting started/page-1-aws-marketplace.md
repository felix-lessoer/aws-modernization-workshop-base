The first step you need to do is to activate Elastic in your AWS account. In order to do so the best way is to subscribe to Elastic via AWS Marketplace using [ela.st/aws](https://ela.st/aws)

During the setup you need to create an Elastic Cloud Account which automatically starts your 7 days trial.

You can skip step 3, which is installing the default Cloud Formation script. We will do that as workshop preparation in a later stage to also install the sample app for you.
Finally click on "Launch product" which will lead you to the Elastic Cloud Configuration protal.
