In order to get credentials from the Elastic environment you need to create an API key within the Elastic Cloud Portal. The easiest way to do is to navigate to [ela.st/cloud-key](https://ela.st/cloud-key). From there just create the API and keep it save for later usage in your cloud formation script.
