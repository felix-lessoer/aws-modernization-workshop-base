At Elastic, we see endless possibilities in a world of endless data. And we use the power of search to help people and organizations turn that possibility into results.

As the leading platform for search-powered solutions, we help everyone — organizations, their employees, and their customers — accelerate the results that matter.

With solutions in Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security, we help people find what they need faster, keep mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats.

Wherever and however our customers put Elastic to work, we help them search, solve, and succeed — at scale and on a single platform. That’s the power of Elastic.

Driving insights and action based on data is critical in order to fully benefit from the agility and flexibility enabled by cloud. With Elastic’s observability solution, you can unify visibility across your entire AWS and on premises environments, enabling better understanding of the availability, performance, and overall health of your infrastructure, applications, and business. AWS gives you a broad range of logs and metrics into their cloud services that allow you to monitor your cloud deployment and make more informed decisions. Elastic Observability integrates with these data sources to bring your data together in a unified manner, enabling you to continuously gain actionable insights into your IT, operations, and business. Easily analyze your data within prebuilt dashboards and tools or build custom visualizations that allow you to react quickly in regards to your business needs.
