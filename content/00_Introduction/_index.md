## What is Elastic?

At Elastic, we see endless possibilities in a world of endless data. And we use the power of search to help people and organizations turn that possibility into results.

As the leading platform for search-powered solutions, we help everyone — organizations, their employees, and their customers — accelerate the results that matter.

With solutions in Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security, we help people find what they need faster, keep mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats.

Wherever and however our customers put Elastic to work, we help them search, solve, and succeed — at scale and on a single platform. That’s the power of Elastic.

Driving insights and action based on data is critical in order to fully benefit from the agility and flexibility enabled by cloud. With Elastic’s observability solution, you can unify visibility across your entire AWS and on premises environments, enabling better understanding of the availability, performance, and overall health of your infrastructure, applications, and business. AWS gives you a broad range of logs and metrics into their cloud services that allow you to monitor your cloud deployment and make more informed decisions. Elastic Observability integrates with these data sources to bring your data together in a unified manner, enabling you to continuously gain actionable insights into your IT, operations, and business. Easily analyze your data within prebuilt dashboards and tools or build custom visualizations that allow you to react quickly in regards to your business needs.


## Use Cases that can get achieved after finishing the workshop

*Cloud monitoring*
Elastic Observability allows your IT team to review, observe, and manage operational workflows in an automated way for insights across platforms and cloud environments.

*DevOps*
Enable your DevOps teams to improve how they bring apps to market by leveraging Elastic Observability across the entire app lifecycle.

*Cloud migration*
Gain deep visibility into cloud and on-premises environments with Elastic Observability, leveraging insights on your infrastructure, migration dependencies, and more.

*Cloud-native*
As cloud-native apps evolve, use Elastic Observability for visibility across the entire cloud-native stack, bringing logs, metrics, and traces together for better context.

*AIOps*
Elastic Observability can help AIOps teams use automation to simplify troubleshooting, speeding anomaly detection and problem resolution.

## How to consume the workshop

The workshop consists of three major parts:

1. Observing the AWS platform
2. Observing Apps running on AWS
3. Observing vulnerabilities and compliance

Each part can be done separately. However, if you want to learn how best to use Elastic (in order to consolidate your tool landscape, save costs, etc.), we recommend you complete the full workshop.
