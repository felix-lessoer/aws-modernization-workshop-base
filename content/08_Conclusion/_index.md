After finishing the workshop your Elastic Environment is set up to collect and visualize all necessary data in order to observe everything that is happening within your infrastructure.

To finalize the setup it is necessary to include Elastic in your day to day processes. Best way to do this is adding alerting rules for your Machine Learning jobs and also for specific data / events that needs your attention.

After setting up your set of alerting rules you might also want to automate the response to it. Every Elastic alert can have multiple connectors. That enables notifications as well as custom actions through e.g. webhooks.
