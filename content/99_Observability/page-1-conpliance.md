## Observing vulnerabilities and compliance
Operating your services within AWS enables you to use the wide range of AWS specific offerings in your application. Because of the complexity and the many different configuration options as well as the shared responsibilities between AWS your company its also possible to operate with less secure setups.

In order to prevent that Elastic also offers to support you with observing the configurations of your used services.

To observe and prevent vulnerabilities you can use the Elastic Endpoint Integration that is part of the Elastic agent and use this to prevent any kind of malware or ransomware attacks to your used EC2 instances. Like with all other integrations the activation only needs a few clicks and is done after a few minutes.

To also observe compliance and configuration issues Elastic also provides Cloud Posture management in order to execute automatic audits and benchmarks against your environment.
